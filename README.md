# XLIB NOTEBAR

Project under construction.


## What is this project?
Xlib notebar features a simple and elegant way to keep your notes everywhere with a tiny, modificable and movable bar in the sides of your screen.

This comes as a way for me to study the whole C++ language better and get the hang of Xlib and similar libraries.

Please expect a lot of bugs and non working things.

Any advice or issue tickets will be very greatly appreciated.
